TODO list to be more KDE compliant:

TODO list of new features:

* Rework Scanner selection dialog.
* Added methods to get strings info from scanner device to be hosted later in
  image metadata (dpi, color mode, etc)
* Progressive final scan: scan can provide huge image especially in 16 bits color depth.
  Send image data to host application by block, not the whole image at once.
* Move the scan reading to a thread to get a more responcive UI.
