TODO list of new features:

* Progressive final scan: scan can provide huge image especially in 16 bits color depth.
Send image data to host application by block, not the whole image at once.
* Add public api to get a list of all available devices.
* Make it possible to hide the final scan button. (could be used for multi page scanning)
* Rename "Other options" to "Scanner specific options"
